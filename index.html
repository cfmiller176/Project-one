<div class="my-career">
    <p> I started my career in law enforcement in 1999 at the age of 20. I spent the next 22 years in law enforcement experiencing many different positions within the Mansfield Police Department. From 1999 to 2007 I worked in the Communications division as a 911 operator. During this time I obtained multiple licenses including my Master Telecommunicator license. In 2007, I attended the North Texas Regional Police Academy and graduated with a Basic Peace Officer License. I also maintained my license as a 911 Dispatcher and was often able to cover shifts for the division.  I also went on to obtain my Intermediate Police Officer License. In 2015 I attended a Basic Hostage Negotiation Certification course and in 2016 was accepted as part of the Crisis Negotiation team. In 2016 I made the decision to return to the Communications Division as a 911 operator and continued my work on the Crisis Negotiation team. In 2022 I made the decision to retire from law enforcement and begin a new chapter of my life. In 2022 I started an online bootcamp with Hofstra University where I will obtain certification to become a Full Stack Web Developer. I am very excited to begin this new career and overcome new challenges ahead of me. </p>
